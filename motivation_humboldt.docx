Dear Prof. , 

as a management student I am very interested in how to bring new technologies especially in the tech sector to many customers, 
so that many people can benefit from them. Cloud computing, the internet of things as well as transformer-based Foundation models 
for deep learning offer new perspective to understand the interests of customers and to bring solutions to them. Germany as country 
with a long tradition of Engineering and Manufacturing faces many opportunities to use AI. 

I would like to contribute to this development and contribute to the economic development in this direction. 
Managing Data is an important element in the increasingly interconnected world. Based on my previous experience from Data-crawling projects 
I would employ this knowledge to find commercial solutions, may it for more efficient production lines for electrical cars, 
safety understanding of various devices, or medical engineering, where the reduction of cost, is a quintessential necessity. 

Since your university studies research fields, this fits well with my projects and interests% show, that we studied the research fields carefully

As an outgoing person, I like to meet people from diverse backgrounds in order to enrich my horizon and be able to understand, 
how different fields of expertise are interconnected. 

Hopefully, this short overview, over my motivation shows you, how I would like to contribute to your field. About 
an invitation to a talk, I would be very thankful. 

// perh. TODO: coach Jiayi for application talks, must come over sympathetically

Best Regards,
Jiayi Zhang
