Dear Prof. , 

as a management student I am very interested in how to bring new technologies especially in the tech sector to many customers, 
so that many people can benefit from them. Cloud computing, the internet of things as well as transformer-based Foundation models 
for deep learning offer new perspective to understand the interests of customers and to bring solutions to them. Germany as country 
with a long tradition of Engineering and Manufacturing faces many opportunities to use AI. 

I would like to contribute to this development and contribute to the economic development in this direction. 

Best Regards,
Jiayi Zhang
